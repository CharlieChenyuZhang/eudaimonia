Motivated by a MIT course "MAS.S61 - What is a Better Future?" taught in Spring 2025 by Prof. Rosalind W. Picard, Sc.D. and Rev. Nathan Barczi, Ph.D.
During this course, I had a coversation with Roz and she mentioned the importance of realizing one's local maxima and minima and sometimes, we need to shake it a bit to get out of the local minima. But it's important to understand the boundary and the restrain. Roz also mentioned that life is multi-dimentional and the 2-D chart is a overly simplieid estimation. This reminds me of the wellness wheel I saw before. 

Motivated by this conversation, I developed this tool to do a self-assessment and it would help visualize all aspects of life.
